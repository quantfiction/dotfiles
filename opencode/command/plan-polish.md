# Plan Polish
Convert a rough plan into an implementation-grade Technical Design Document.

## What this does
- Expands rough plans into detailed, implementation-ready designs
- Verifies dependencies, APIs, and integration points
- Identifies edge cases and failure modes
- Creates comprehensive documentation for autonomous agent execution

## Usage
Paste your rough plan and relevant context. The agent will:
1. Analyze dependencies and versions
2. Verify API/SDK surface areas
3. Check codebase integration patterns
4. Enumerate edge cases
5. Produce a complete Technical Design Document with 14 sections

## Required inputs
- Rough plan from Stage 1
- Relevant repo context (file tree, key files, conventions)
- Current dependency manifest (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- External APIs/services involved (with docs links if available)
